Error handling in Express: An overview

Operational Errors
Problems that we can predict will happen at some point, 
so we just need to handle them in advance.
- Invalid path accessed;
- Invalid user input (validation error from mongoose);
- Failed to connect to server;
- Failed to connect to database;
- Request timeout;
- Etc.

Programming Errors
Bugs that we developers introduce into our code. 
Difficult to find and handle.
- Reading properties on undefined; 
- Passing a number where an object is expected;
- Using await without async;
- Using req.query instead of req.body;
- Etc.
